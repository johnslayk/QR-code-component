## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Searching I found the difference between "align-items" and "justify-content".
I also spent some time looking for how to align a "div" and found that it can easily be aligned with "margin: auto"


### Continued development

I started a short time ago, I still try to continue learning more about html and css, then pick up to study javascript and try to apply it in some other projects.
